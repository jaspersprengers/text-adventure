# The text adventure game api

This is a fun example of an api to build your own text adventures, while at the same time teaching the Java module system.

The maven project consists of 4 api modules and two implementations:
* api: provides the interfaces and core classes that you need to build your own story
* engine: runs the stories in a user interface (Swing or console), by acting as a service locator for modules that implement the Story api.
* Then there are two projects that implement, each in a single java file packaged as a module.

Later adventure stories can be added to the module path, to be picked up by the engine and presented as selectable.


## Running the application
To compile and package the modules into jars, each in their respective target folder, run:
```bash
mvn package
```
Ideally, all modules should go in a single module path, but you can specify multiple paths on the `-p` option.
```bash
java -p api/target/api.jar:engine/target/engine.jar:fellowship/target/fellowship.jar:secretkey/target/secretkey.jar --module adventure.engine/adventure.engine.Adventure
# Alternatively, you can use adventure.engine/adventure.engine.AdventureSwing to run the graphical version
```

## Adding a new story
To add a new story, you need to create a new module that implements the `adventure.api.Story` interface.
The module should have a module-info.java file with a dependency on the api module.
```java
module cool.adventure {
    requires adventure.api;
    provides adventure.api.Story with coolgames.MyAdventure;
}
```
It should also declare the `Story` implementation as a service provider, so that the engine can find it.
```java
